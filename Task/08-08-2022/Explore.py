'''Lock ->
==========
The Lock object can be held by only one thread at a time. If any other thread wants the same lock then it will have to wait until the other one releases it.
Itâ€™s similar to waiting in line to book a train ticket, public telephone booth etc.

acquire() method: A Thread can acquire the lock by using acquire() method
l.acquire()
release() method: A Thread can release the lock by using release() method.
l.release()

Note: Only the thread currently holding the lock is allowed to call the release() method thread,
otherwise we will get Runtime Error saying, RuntimeError: release unlocked lock'''
