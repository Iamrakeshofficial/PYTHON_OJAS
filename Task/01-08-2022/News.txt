In following example, a class named distance is defined with two instance attributes - ft and inch.
        The addition of these two distance objects is desired to be performed using the overloading + operator.
        To achieve this, the magic method __add__() is overridden, which performs the addition of the ft
        and inch attributes of the two objects. The __str__() method returns the object's string representation.
        Magic methods are most frequently used to define overloaded behaviours of
        predefined operators in Python. For instance, arithmetic operators by default operate upon numeric operands.
        This means that numeric objects must be used along with operators like +, -, *, /, etc.
        The + operator is also
        defined as a concatenation operator in string, list and tuple classes.
        We can say that the + operator is overloaded.
