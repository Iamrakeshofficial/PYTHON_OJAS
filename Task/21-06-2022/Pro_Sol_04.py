'''given integer n as input, write a program to display the sum of the first n terms in harmonic series.

The series is:1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+......+1/N (N terms)

input:
      The first line of input is an integer N

output:
      print the sum rounded upto 2 decimal places
explanation:
      for n=5
      the sum of first 5 terms in harmonic series 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5
      so, the output should be 2.28
sample input1: 5
sample output1: 2.28
sample input2: 3
sample output2: 1.83'''
